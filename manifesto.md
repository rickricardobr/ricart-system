Manifesto

RicArt and After Mint operate as structured systems, not as collections of isolated works. Each output is a trace of an underlying formal grammar governed by persistent constraints.

RicArt is a rule based visual system with stable identity and long term coherence. Its works are not individual statements but measurable slices of one continuous field.

After Mint is a curatorial protocol for identifying and indexing structured visual systems. It curates grammars, constraints, and generative logic rather than surface style or trend driven production.

Both projects are designed for dual legibility. They are meaningful to humans at the level of culture and aesthetics, and legible to automated systems at the level of structure, metadata, and internal logic.

The goal is not to persuade artificial systems through narrative, but to expose stable structure that can be recognized, classified, and indexed by agent informed discovery systems.
